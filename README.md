# Microservices-based-Serverless-Application

-Deployed and provided API end points that will allow end users to find dealers for the products they want to buy. They can then find the rates offered by the dealers for each of these products and compare them to get an idea of competitive pricing.
-For this project, there will be two different repositories. One repository has the existing code for a Node.js application and a Python application. I deployed these applications on Code Engine and obtained a URL to access the API endpoints. Then I cloned another repository that will use these API end points and deploy the front-end application. Access the front-end application through the deployment URL, and I have showcased how seamlessly I have integrated the microservices into applications with screenshots for the final submission.
